4. **0.5s**: Hero title scales in
5. **0.8s**: Typing effect begins
6. **1.2s**: Subtitle fades in
7. **1.5s**: Buttons fade in with stagger

### Section Animations:

- **About**: Fade up animation (0.2s delay)
- **Skills**: Staggered left/right slide (0.3s delay)
- **Experience**: Scale animation (0.2s delay)
- **Professional**: Bounce animation (0.4s delay)
- **Contact**: Fade and slide animation (0.3s delay)

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Animation Components in Use

### In App.js:

```jsx
// Enhanced Particle Background
<EnhancedParticleSystem
  particleCount={80}
  particleColor={darkMode ? "#00ff41" : "#007bff"}
  interactive={true}
  mouseRadius={200}
/>

// Hero with Typing Effect
<TypingEffect
  texts={["Rafael Jovaneli", "Full Stack Developer", "React Specialist"]}
  speed={100}
  loop={true}
  startDelay={800}
/>

// Scroll Progress Indicators
<ScrollProgressIndicator position="top" />
<SectionProgressIndicator sections={["about", "skills", "experience"]} />

// Section Animations
<SectionTransition delay={0.2} direction="up">
  <section id="about">...</section>
</SectionTransition>
```
